USER STORY

  As a user, I can vote for my favorite iconic hairstyle.

  As a moderator, I want to create a voting and tracking game that
  will have the user vote on the hairstyle.

  As a moderator, I want only two random images to appear on the screen 
  so the user only votes for one image at a time.

  
  As moderator, I want the user to click on the favorite image so that the 
  voting tracker is initialized and the results are displayed in graphical
  form.
